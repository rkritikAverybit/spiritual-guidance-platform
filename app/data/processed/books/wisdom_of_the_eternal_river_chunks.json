  "Wisdom of the Eternal River Chapter 1: Flow Like Water The river does not struggle to reach the ocean. It flows with trust, winding around stones and mountains. In the same way, the soul finds its home when it flows with life, not agai nst it. To resist is to suffer, but to trust is to arrive. Chapter 2: The Mirror of Compassion Every person you meet is a reflection of your own inner world. When you respond with kindn ess, the world mirrors kindness back to you. Hatred multiplies itself when returned, but c ompassion dissolves it at its root."
