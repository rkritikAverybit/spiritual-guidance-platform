  "Chapter 1: The Self Within The Upanishads declare that the Self is eternal, unchanging, and present in all beings. It cannot be destroyed, nor diminished, for it is the witness of all experience. When a seeker realizes this, fear disappears and freedom begins. Chapter 2: From Darkness to Light Lead me from the unreal to the real, from darkness to light, from death to immortality. This ancient prayer is a reminder that truth is not found in appearances, but in the eternal essence that shines in every heart."
