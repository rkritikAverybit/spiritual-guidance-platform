  "Path of Inner Peace Chapter 1: The Beginning of Stillness Peace is not something you chase outside yourself, it is the natural fragrance of a calm h eart. When you sit in silence, the noise of the world softens, and you begin to hear the v oice of your own spirit. Every breath is an entry point into the temple of awareness. To w alk the path of inner peace is to learn to pause, to notice, and to release. Chapter 2: Breathing as Prayer Each inhale is a gift, and each exhale is a letting go. When the mind becomes restless, re turn to the breath. It anchors you in the present, reminding you that life is not found in yesterday or tomorrow, but only here, in this very moment."
